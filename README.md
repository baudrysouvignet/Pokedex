# Pokedex

Pokedex was a project undertaken during my final year of high school as part of the NSI (Digital and Computer Science) specialization.
The main objective of this project was to explore SQL for the first time using SQLite. A few months later, in another project, we worked with MySQL and PhpMyAdmin.
For this project, I wanted to challenge myself by creating a layout like a mobile and a new page for each application (accounts, statistics, arena, Pok√©dex).
